# investigate-a-dataset
My submission for the Udacity "investigate A Dataset" project. I chose the medical appointment no-show data set, where we look at which factors are correlated with someone attending or missing their appointment. I go through the basic data analysis process, from assessing and cleaning the data, to exploring it with basic visualizations.
